Changes in the domain that have impact on the database model:

1. se.qbranch.qanban.UserEvent*

   The constraints on 'username' was UNIQUE in UserEventCreate wich
was the only existing user event until recently. This makes creation
of multiple user events impossible because all events use one table
per hierarky. 
   This has now been set to !unique in the class UserEventCreate
aswell as in the new events classes; UserEventDelete and
UserEventUpdate.
   
   For further information about this issue and it's complications
